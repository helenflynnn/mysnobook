# Intro

In snow-dominated watersheds, snowmelt contributions to streamflow cause a peak in the hydrograph in spring with low flows returning in the fall. This paper defines baseflow as daily streamflow with between 50 and 90 percent probability of exceedance (Smakhtin, 2001), and this also referred to as low flow. Baseflow originating as snowmelt sustains communities on Colorado's Front Range during the winter months while water accumulates in the high elevation snowpack. In the spring, snowmelt adds significant quantities of water and increasessing flows in these streams and rivers, However, the influence of snowpack on baseflow in the fall and winter is less understood (Hammond & Kampf, 2020).

The traditional U.S. water year (WY, October 1st to September 30th) begins with low flows from a previous year's snowpack (Figure 1). As the WY progresses, snow accumulates in the mountains and then begins to melt in the spring, generating a peak in the hydrograph. After peak melt, streamflow returns to low flows in the late summer and early fall. Thus, the WY contains two periods of baseflow that have influenced by snowpack from two different years (Figure 2).

There are several different methods that have been used to determine baseflow including baseflow separation, frequency analysis, and flow duration curves (FDC) (Smakhtin, 2001). Additionally, tracing the movement of stable isotopes is another way to measure baseflow. Researchers have used 15-day running minimum as a proxy for baseflow as well (Cooper et al., 2018; Godsey et al., 2013). In Miller et al. 2014, they found that "baseflow ranged from as low as 40%, but up to 86%, of streamflow during low flow conditions." They did this using isotope tracers in large basins in the Upper Colorado River Basin. For the purposes of this study, we assumed that 100% of low flow was baseflow due to the smaller size and snow-dominated nature of the basins.

Similar research has been conducted in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California using modeling to predict how summer low flows will be impacted by changes in peak SWE under a warming climate (Godsey et al., 2013). This research also suggests that there is a lag time or "memory" between when snow years deviating from average resulting in deviating baseflow.

## Objectives

To understand more about how water moves through these snow-dominated systems watersheds, our goals were:

-   Compute baseflow that occurs after snowmelt and correlate peak SWE and baseflow

    -   Implement a melt year (MY) approach that identifies baseflow using that seasons' snowmelt

-   Correlate baseflow and peak SWE using a yearly lag from 0 to 5 years

-   Contrast low-snow and high-snow years to correlate peak SWE and baseflow over subsequent years

-   Appraise the peak SWE versus baseflow correlation as a function of basin characteristics such as drainage area, elevation, and latitude
