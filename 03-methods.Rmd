## Data

To analyze the correlation between peak SWE and baseflow, discharge data from 13 USGS gauges in the Southern Rockies of Colorado were examined from October 1st, 1979, to September 30th, 2022. Stations with greater than ten percent missing data during the time period were excluded. The drainage basins that contain each stream gauge vary in latitude, elevation and area (Table 1). Each stream gauge was paired with an NRCS SNOTEL station within or just outside the drainage basin (Table 1). When the nearest SNOTEL station was lacking data, another nearby station was selected based on the clusters defined by Fassnacht and Derry (2010). Peak SWE data from the SNOTEL stations were used.

## Methods 

In snow dominated watersheds, the hydrograph demonstrates a large peak occurring at the onset of melt that eventually levels off at lower values for most of the rest of the year. The traditional water year (WY, in the US October 1 through September 30) separates peak melt and baseflow into two different WYs. To reflect the hydrologic processes that are occurring in snow-dominated watersheds, we propose using a melt year (MY) beginning with the onset of snowmelt (the first deviation from baseflow) and ending with the onset of the following year’s snowmelt (Figure 2). The beginning of the MY was defined as the day at which the rate of increase in discharge changes.

To find the onset of melt, the cumulative sum of the runoff was calculated for each water year. Using the cumulative sum, the onset of melt was selected as the first day when the daily slope was K times greater than the baseflow slope. The constant K was determined to be 6 after testing other values in order to ensure that an onset of melt date was selected for a reasonable time frame. The baseflow slope was calculated between January 1 and March 31.

save(MY_sitedata, file = 'data/my_sitedata.RData')
```

Once the MY was identified, we ranked and found the probability of exceedance for each discharge value. Flow duration curves (FDC) were constructed by plotting the discharge values against the probability of exceedance for each value per year (Figure 3). The discharge values that fell within 50-90% probability were deemed to be baseflow (Smakhtin, 2001) (Figure 3).  Then, we directly correlated peak SWE and the average baseflow values from the same MY. We also compared average baseflow to the previous years’ peak SWE using a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0-year lag. For example, MY 1980 average baseflow was compared to peak SWE from MY 1975-1980.

Then, we directly correlated peak SWE and the average baseflow values from the same MY. We also compared average baseflow to the previous years’ peak SWE using a 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, and 0-year lag. For example, MY 1980 average baseflow was compared to peak SWE from MY 1975-1980.

The peak SWE values were sorted into low, average, and high snow years using a histogram separating the bins by 0.5 standard deviations from the mean. A multivariate regression was run on average baseflow values with the intercept being a 0–5-year lag to peak SWE. This was calculated for low, high and all snow years. Covariance was calculated for the same parameters as well. Finally, the standard deviation and coefficient of variation (COV) of the average baseflow and peak SWE were calculated for each station pair. The COV was calculated by dividing the standard deviation by the mean for both baseflow and peak SWE.

The Fraser sites were used as a case study to examen the results on a small signular basin scale. 

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
fraser <- read_csv(file = 'data/readyforcorrel.csv', col_names = TRUE)
highsno <- mean(fraser$max_swe) + sd(fraser$max_swe)*0.5
lowsno <- mean(fraser$max_swe) - sd(fraser$max_swe)*0.5
mean <- mean(fraser$max_swe)
```

Basin characteristics like drainage area, elevation, and latitude were then examined with respect to the results from the correlation between peak SWE and baseflow as well as the contrast between 0-5-year lags.
